GCsnap
GCsnap is a python-based, local tool that generates interactive snapshots of 
conserved protein-coding genomic contexts.
Thanks for using it!  💙

✅  Done configuration file config.yaml loaded
✅  Done parsing CLI arguments and config.yaml
✅  Done parsing targets
🔨 Working on Task 10000_4_2_8_5 with 10000 targets
  ⚠️  2143 ids is not containd in mapping database. Check 
gcsnap_10000_4_2_8_5.log
✅  Done all mapping done. Table saved to mapping.csv
✅  Done mapping 
✅  Done download assemblies and extract flanking genes
  ⚠️  Partial genomic blocks for 1029 target sequences excluded. Set 
--exclude-partial False to include. Check gcsnap_10000_4_2_8_5.log
  ⚠️  No flanking genes found for 377 target sequences. Check 
gcsnap_10000_4_2_8_5.log
✅  Done add sequences, tax id and species name to flanking genes
✅  Done syntenies information written to genomic_context_information.json
✅  Done prepare data for MMseqs
✅  Done running MMseqs
✅  Done extracting distance matrix
✅  Done find clusters
✅  Done assigning families to flanking genes
✅  Done create families summary
        Found 6299 conserved protein families, 774 pseudogenes and 19096 
non-conserved protein coding regions
  Functional annotation needs mapping first
  ⚠️  6084 ids is not containd in mapping database. Check 
gcsnap_10000_4_2_8_5.log
✅  Done all mapping done. Table saved to mapping.csv
✅  Done mapping for functional annotation
✅  Done get functional annotations and structures

        Selected 31 operon/genomic_context types, with most populated 
corresponding to GC Type 02361
✅  Done selected operon written to selected_operons.json
✅  Done find and map taxonomy
✅  Done taxonomy information written to taxonomy.json
TM annotation set to False. Transmembrane segments and signal peptides will not 
be searched
